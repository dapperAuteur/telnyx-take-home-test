# Anthony's Telnyx-Node SMS Take Home Test

Tutorial I followed to build this.

Repo with VERY similar code. I should've forked it. LOL.

Sample application demonstrating Telnyx-Node SMS 
</div>

## Getting Started



## Documentation & Tutorial

The full documentation and tutorial is available on [developers.telnyx.com](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/development/dev-env-setup?lang=dotnet&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link)

## Pre-Reqs

You will need to set up:

* [Telnyx Account](https://telnyx.com/sign-up?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link)
* [Telnyx Phone Number](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/numbers/my-numbers?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link) enabled with:
* Ability to receive webhooks (with something like [ngrok](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/development/ngrok?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link))
* [Node & NPM](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/development/dev-env-setup?lang=node&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link) installed

## What you can do

* Send an SMS and receive a response back to your phone number. The response is based on the content of the text message sent.

## Usage

The following environmental variables need to be set

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TELNYX_API_KEY`       | Your [Telnyx API Key](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/api-keys?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link)              |
| `TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY`    | Your [Telnyx Public Key](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/account/public-key?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link) |
| `TELNYX_APP_PORT`      | **Defaults to `5000`** The port the app will be served                                                                                                   |


### .env file

This app uses the excellent [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package to manage environment variables.

Make a copy of [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample) and save as `.env` and update the variables to match your creds.

```
TELNYX_API_KEY=
TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY=
TENYX_APP_PORT=5000
```

### Callback URLs For Telnyx Applications

| Callback Type                    | URL                              |
|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Inbound Message Callback         | `{ngrok-url}/messaging/inbound`  |
| Outbound Message Status Callback | `{ngrok-url}/messaging/outbound` |

### Install

Run the following commands to get started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/d-telnyx/demo-node-telnyx.git
```

### Ngrok

This application is served on the port defined in the runtime environment (or in the `.env` file). Be sure to launch [ngrok](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/development/ngrok?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=github_referral&utm_campaign=cross-site-link) for that port

```
./ngrok http 5000
```

> Terminal should look _something_ like

```
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                                               (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status                online
Account                       Little Bobby Tables (Plan: Free)
Version                       2.3.35
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://your-url.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
Forwarding                    https://your-url.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

At this point you can point your application to generated ngrok URL + path  (Example: `http://{your-url}.ngrok.io/messaging/inbound`).

### Run

Start the server `node index.js`

When you are able to run the server locally, the final step involves making your application accessible from the internet. So far, we've set up a local web server. This is typically not accessible from the public internet, making testing inbound requests to web applications difficult.

The best workaround is a tunneling service. They come with client software that runs on your computer and opens an outgoing permanent connection to a publicly available server in a data center. Then, they assign a public URL (typically on a random or custom subdomain) on that server to your account. The public server acts as a proxy that accepts incoming connections to your URL, forwards (tunnels) them through the already established connection and sends them to the local web server as if they originated from the same machine. The most popular tunneling tool is `ngrok`. Check out the [ngrok setup](/docs/v2/development/ngrok) walkthrough to set it up on your computer and start receiving webhooks from inbound messages to your newly created application.

Once you've set up `ngrok` or another tunneling service you can add the public proxy URL to your Inbound Settings  in the Mission Control Portal. To do this, click  the edit symbol [✎] next to your Messaging Profile. In the "Inbound Settings" > "Webhook URL" field, paste the forwarding address from ngrok into the Webhook URL field. Add `messaging/inbound` to the end of the URL to direct the request to the webhook endpoint in your  server.

For now you'll leave “Failover URL” blank, but if you'd like to have Telnyx resend the webhook in the case where sending to the Webhook URL fails, you can specify an alternate address in this field.

Once everything is setup, you should now be able to:
* Text your phone number and receive a response!
* Send a picture to your phone number and get that same picture right back!
